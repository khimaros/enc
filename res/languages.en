this data file contains all possible mappings between file extension and the plain english name for that filetype.

for files which don't have an extension (eg. Makefile) the full name is used in place of the extension.

the data structure includes non-programming language file types such as CSV and SVG, really any text based format can be found here.

the data structure is an object with key being the file extension or file name and the value being the plain language name of that filetype. for example `{".rs": "rust", ".py": "python"}`

the ".en" file extension is mapped as "english"
