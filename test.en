this is the description for a goldens test harness

usage: test <update|test|help>

to update/test, the "tests" make target should be built (make -B)

on update, the result of the build including all shell history is saved to goldens

output of the `make` command (lines beginning with `make: ` or `make[`) will be filtered out.

when running make targets, both stdout and stderr should be captured together. the filtered output should always be echoed before returning, even if the target fails with non-zero exit status.

the name of the golden output files should have "/" in target names replaced with "-"

on test, the same results are computed and compared to the goldens

goldens are stored in ./testdata/goldens/

temporary output for comparison is stored in ./testdata/output/

any directories needed to store the output are created before hand

the test runner produces very detailed logging to stderr

all integers and floating point numbers are discarded when comparing to goldens

for example this diff results in a PASS:
