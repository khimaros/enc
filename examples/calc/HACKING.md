# HACKING

DON'T EVER use libraries from a third party URL.

keep dependencies to an ABSOLUTE minimum and use standard library whenever possible.

keep the code "DRY" and organized into small functions.

ideally, keep functions to fewer than 50 lines.

use pure functions without side effects whenever possible.
