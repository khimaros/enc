# enc/examples/interlang

this example demonstrates transpilation between programming languages

in this case, we go from english -> python -> c

in other word: `enc main.en -o main.py && enc main.py -o main.c`

this example assumes that you've [installed](../../README.md#installation) enc

to build and run this example, run `make run`
