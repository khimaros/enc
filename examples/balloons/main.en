this is the main entrypoint for the program

the program opens a window when started

the window has colorful balloons floating up the screen randomly

the balloons should have a realistic shape (rounded and oblong, as real balloons are)

when the user clicks on the balloons they pop and confetti comes out

the balloon asset is "balloon.png" which is generated from "balloon.svg"

there should be a retro stock ticker continuously scrolling across the bottom
