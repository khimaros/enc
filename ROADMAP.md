```
[@] solution for build boilerplate (Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, etc)

[ ] build ./res/ resources into the rust binary
[ ] move language map out into separate data file
[ ] ensure deterministic output with the same input file
[ ] standardize writing style in prompt template

[?] split src/enc.en into separate files

[x] golden tests
[x] rust port
[x] create an example with multiple source files
[x] move pricing data out into a separate data file
[x] support for additional context files
