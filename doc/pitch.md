# `enc`: stop writing boilerplate, start writing intent

`enc` is a CLI tool designed for engineers who are tired of the context-switching tax between high-level architectural intent and low-level implementation details. it transpiles your english specifications (`.en` files) directly into production-ready source code in any language.

unlike standard chat interfaces that leave you copy-pasting into a terminal like a human intermediate, `enc` treats the LLM as a proper transpilation target.

### the self-healing loop

the core of `enc` is its iterative test-driven refinement. you provide a `--test-command` (e.g., `make test` or `cargo test`), and `enc` will:
1.  generate the target code.
2.  execute your test suite in a restricted environment.
3.  if the tests fail, it captures the `stdout`/`stderr` and feeds it back to the model.
4.  iterate until the code actually works or the budget is hit.

it's not just "ai code generation"; it's a closed-loop system for verified output.

### engineering-first features

hackers care about the details. `enc` is built with a minimalist, dependency-light philosophy:

- **multi-provider transparency**: native support for Claude 3.7 (with extended thinking/SSE streaming), Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5.
- **cost accounting**: every run provides a detailed token breakdown and estimated cost in USD, including thinking tokens.
- **deterministic-ish**: supports `seed` values where providers allow, and forces `temperature: 0` elsewhere for reproducible builds.
- **context-aware**: inject your `HACKING.md` conventions directly into the prompt to ensure the output matches your team's style and standard library preferences.
- **zero clutter**: no explanatory prose, no markdown fluff—just pure source code written to your output path.

### usage

```console
$ enc ./logic.en -o ./logic.rs --test-command "cargo test"
```

it’s built for the developer who knows exactly what they want but doesn't want to type out the same three hundred lines of boilerplate to get there.

`enc`: because your compiler should understand you.
