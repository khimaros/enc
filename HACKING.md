# HACKING

keep dependencies to a minimum and prefer standard library.

without making the code cryptic, prefer to reduce the total line count. remove dead code and unnecessary or obvious comments.

code comments and command line output should be all lowercase, though CAPS can be used for acronyms or for emphasis.

keep the code "DRY" and organized into small functions. ideally, keep functions to fewer than 50 lines. use pure functions without side effects whenever possible.
